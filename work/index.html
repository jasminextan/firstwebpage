                last year, i started working for the graphite group, a student run consulting group that specializes in startups and small businesses.
                 my first client was an edutech company, and my second semester i was promoted to a team lead.
                 now, i help lead graphite digital, the branch that focuses on marketing, ui/ux design, and data science.
                 this semester, my team is working with a company that aims to standardize data privacy and management within the restaurant industry.
            </p>
            <p id="vidyatext">
                i actually started learning about ui/ux to better lead my team. 
                 i used one of the tools i've learned (figma) to help design this webpage.

                <p>this summer, i collaborated with two economics professors from claremont mckenna college to analyze labor markets during covid-19.
                     hopefully, we will eventually derrive how unemployment, remote work, and market trends impacted labor market movement and how individuals decide to move during the pandemic.
                     during the 2023 spring semester, i will be working with professor julio garin to continue this research.
                </p>
                <p>i also worked as a research and teaching assistant for the berger institute, researching the moral foundations theory and working to create programming centered around charitable thinking.
                     during the school year, i now work to help reshape the priorities, structure, and branding for both the berger institute and the applied mind and health laboratory.
