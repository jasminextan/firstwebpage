                i love videogames!
                my first game was call of duty, but i've been getting into more resource management indie games recently.
                i'm currently a beta tester for the wandering village!
                i built my own pc at the start of covid-19, and i ended up selling it and getting a new prebuilt mini tower.
                feel free to check out my videogame tier list below!

            <p id="vidyatext">
                i started streaming during covid-19, and from the very beginning, I designed my channel around analytics.
                 i looked at successful streamers, trending content, and my own data. 
                 i had a rule- for every three hours i streamed, i'd spend one dedicated to analysis and improvement.
                 by the time i'd streamed 150 hours, i had 5.8k total views and was in the top 1.2% of streamers internationally. 
                 i absolutely love getting to meet people from around the world!

                i started 3d modeling because i wanted to design custom figures for my dungeons and dragons campaign.
                 since then, i've built my own 3d printer, designed and ran a course on digital design for the university of chicago laboratory schools, and created a senior thesis on repraps (3d printed 3d printers).

                <p>i grew up playing a lot of sports, but i love to joke that i'm scared of balls. 
                     i always avoided sports like soccer, tennis, or basketball.
                     instead, growing up, i did competitive figure skating.
                     in high school, i did competitive karate and varsity fencing.
                     i was the 2018 national us karate champion for my division, and was the women's foil fencing varsity team captain for four years.
                </p>
                <p>nowadays, i'm a big fan of rollerskating and hot-girl-walks.
                    i rollerskate to get around campus, and i've recently started participating in the conquerer challenges.
                     they set concrete mile goals for me to complete; i just recently finished the angkor wat challenge, a hike of about 20 miles.
                     i completed it in about two weeks, just going on walks around campus and treadmilling in the gym with friends.
